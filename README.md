Zombie Infestation Simulation in C#

This program is a simulation of a fictional zombie infestation, built in C# to explore concepts of game design and artificial intelligence. It features an environment where users can observe or interact with zombie and human characters, each following specific movement patterns and behaviors. The simulation incorporates algorithms for pathfinding, collision detection, and randomization to create a dynamic and engaging experience. This project showcases skills in C# programming, object-oriented design, and AI, providing a unique way to visualize and experiment with behavior-driven development.
