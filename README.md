Zombie Infestation Simulation
I created this Zombie Infestation Simulation in C# to explore game design and artificial intelligence concepts in an interactive way. 
Hereâ€™s what makes this project stand out:
Dynamic Simulation: The program simulates a fictional zombie infestation, featuring both zombie and human characters with distinct movement patterns and behaviors.
Engaging Interactivity: Users can observe or interact with the simulation environment, adding a hands-on element to the experience.
Advanced Algorithms: I implemented pathfinding, collision detection, and randomization algorithms to make the simulation realistic and dynamic.
Skill Demonstration: This project highlights my expertise in C# programming, object-oriented design, and AI, showcasing behavior-driven development in action.
